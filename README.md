# AWS S3 Lifecycle Policy Project

This repository contains a **Python script that applies a lifecycle policy to an Amazon S3 bucket** using the **Boto3 SDK**.

The lifecycle policy automatically transitions objects to a lower-cost storage class (**STANDARD\_IA**) after 30 days and deletes them after 365 days. This project demonstrates how to use Python for **cloud cost optimization and storage management**.

---

## What You’ll Learn

* Using **Boto3** to interact with Amazon S3
* Defining and applying **lifecycle policies** to buckets
* Automating storage cost optimization strategies:

  * Move objects to **Infrequent Access (STANDARD\_IA)** after 30 days
  * Expire/delete objects after 365 days
* Writing Python scripts that integrate with AWS services

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* AWS account with **S3** access
* IAM user/role with permissions for:

  * `s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration`
  * `s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration`
* AWS CLI configured (`aws configure`)
* Python 3.8+ installed
* Boto3 installed:

  ```bash
  pip install boto3
  ```

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/djcloudking/s3-lifecycle-policy.git
cd s3-lifecycle-policy
```

### Run the script

```bash
python3 s3_lifecycle.py
```

## Outcome

With this script, you:

* Automatically transition objects to **lower-cost storage classes** after a set number of days
* Ensure old/unused objects are automatically **deleted** after a year
* Reduce manual intervention in S3 data management
* Apply a **cost optimization best practice** in AWS

---

## Who This Is For

* Cloud engineers learning **S3 lifecycle rules**
* DevOps engineers implementing **cost optimization** strategies
* Developers practicing AWS automation with Python
